## Introduction

The Wallet-Based Menu System is an innovative VR project developed using Unity. The system replaces the typical 2D menu with a 3D wallet object, providing an immersive and interactive experience. Users can view the menu by "opening" the wallet, with menu options displayed as "cards". The wallet menu can be activated by physically interacting with the wallet object or by pressing a dedicated menu button.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/gavinedd/Project-Name.git

2. Open the project in Unity
3. Build the project for your VR platform

## Usage

The wallet menu can be activated by two means:

- Physically collect the wallet object from the environment.
- Press the dedicated menu button on the controller.

Once the wallet is activated, rotate your left hand from palm down to palm up. As this rotation occurs, the "cards" in the wallet splay outwards above the wallet. These "cards" can display any relevant information or options depending on the context.

To exit the menu, rotate the palm of your left hand downwards, and the cards will retract back into the wallet. Alternatively, you can press the same menu button on your controller again.
